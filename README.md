ISSUE 1

ISSUE #2 Select items based on the pre-selected quantity
The user needs to select a quantity first for each section.
After selecting a quantity, the user is only able to select items according to the pre-selected quantity.
Ex: If he selects quantity as 2 in the guns section, he will only be able to select 2 types of guns in the below-selected area.
Give warnings according to the above limitations.
Selecting buttons should be toggleable.

ISSUE #3 Interactive clicks (toggle buttons)
You need to update the subtotal of each section based on the selected item prices.
The subtotal should be updated in real time.If the user unselects an item, the subtotal needs to be reduced, and if he selects an item, it should be increase.

ISSUE #4 Check that the selected item numbers match the selected quantities
When pressing the order now button, you need to check the selected item count in each section to match the quantity you defined at the top.
If the user selects fewer items than defined at the top, give a warning message.

ISSUE #5 Final submit popup and thank you message
After completing all four issues, only you can complete this one.
You should get the subtotal price of the gun prices and inventory and display the total price with a pay-now button in a pop-up box.
When the user clicked the pay now button, a thank-you message was given, and the quantity and other selected items were reset.
You can create a popup and thank-you message UI as you wish.
